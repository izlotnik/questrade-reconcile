The QuestradeReconcile macro is python code that uses the Questrade application programming interface (API) to fetch account, position, balance, equity, and 30 day activity into a LibreOffice spreadsheet file.

This script is meant to be run infrequently to help provide a dashboard view when, for example, re-balancing a portfolio. It is not meant to track real time market conditions.

This project was last tested on February 12th, 2021 and continues  to be fully functional.

This repository is not meant to offer a turnkey application but instead is a useful reference. Nobody ought to allow any application, including this one, access to the Questrade API without first being able to completely understand and audit the code.
