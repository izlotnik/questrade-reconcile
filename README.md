The QuestradeReconcile macro is python code that uses the Questrade application programming interface (API) to fetch account, position, balance, equity, and 30 day activity into a LibreOffice spreadsheet file.

This script is meant to be run infrequently to help provide a dashboard view when, for example, re-balancing a portfolio. It is not meant to track real time market conditions.

This project was last tested on February 12th, 2021 and continues  to be fully functional.

This repository is not meant to offer a turnkey application but instead is a useful reference. Nobody ought to allow any application, including this one, access to the Questrade API without first being able to completely understand and audit the code.

**Prerequistes**

<ul>
   <li>[LibreOffice for spreadsheet functionality](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)</li>
   <li>[7Zip for development](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)</li>
</ul>

**Notes**

LibreOffice must be installed to make use of the included Sample spreadsheet. Python and Basic macros are installed into the spreadsheet file by default.  It represents a really good starting point for a fully customized portfolio tracking application. The spreadsheet file is a standard ODS archive generated by LibreOffice.

LibreOffice has a built-in editor for Basic but not for Python macros. The following is necessary when making Python changes to the spreadsheet file.
